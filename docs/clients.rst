Clients
=======

While you can access RestPose directly over HTTP from any language and
environment which supports making HTTP requests, it will often be more
convenient to use a dedicated client, to provide tighter and smoother
integration into your chosen lanugae.

This section lists the languages for which clients are currently available::

 * Python.  http://github.com/rboulton/restpose-py/  This is an "official"
   client, maintained by the RestPose team.  It is released whenever a new
   version of RestPose server is, and the latest version should always provide
   access to all features of RestPose Server.

If you know of, or implement, a client which isn't already in this list, please
let us know (ideally in the form of a pull request to update this documentation
request).
